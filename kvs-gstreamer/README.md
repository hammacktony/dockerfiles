# KVS Gstreamer


Needs the following environment variables (either pass in the variables one at a time or add an .env file like I did and pass them in.)

```shell
STREAM_NAME=""
AWS_REGION=""
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=""
AWS_SECRET_KEY=""
```

Run `docker-compose build` to build docker image.

Run `docker-compose up` to run the gstreamer producer.

(Note: Docker image name might not be the same as mine.)
